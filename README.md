```

## Usage

### Development


```bash
pnpm dev # SSR development
```

### Build

And you will see the generated files in `dist`, and some of these files will be moved to `serverless` for deployment.

### Deploy on Vercel

Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and install its CLI. Then:

```bash
pnpm preview # Simulate Vercel environment locally
pnpm deploy
pnpm deploy:prod
```
